Once a batch of data points has been seen by the Neural Network (**forward propagation**) and 80% of the weights in a layer have been optimized/updated (**backward propagation** with the **Adam** optimizer), the Neural Network moves on to the forward propagation of the next batch, where it will use:\n",
